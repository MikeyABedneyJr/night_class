MVC notes
Base class: Model, View, Controller
Each item inherits objects from these three

Model: "Data Layer - Holds all of the data
	data = record object---has a variety of keys such as [ {name: "Bob", age: "23"}...]
		almost always a list

	Almost always called a Data Structure - "Where you keep your stuff"
			Aka
			Dict
			Object
			Hashmap
			JSON (javascript object notation) - same as dictionary for most part

View: Presentation Layer
	Templates
	ListView
	Detail View
	Settings View
	HTML**

Controller: Orchestration Layer
	switch
	Request**
	/books/fiction/scifi   <---everything after address bar domain, controller directs
	These are called ROUTES
		Routes = list of URLs
	Django has all URLS in a file called URLS.py


UML (Universal ) - though universal might as well be "User"
	Diagram
	Sequence

Typing on computer --> browser/Client
							<--> REQUESTS GO HERE
									<--> Web Server 
												<-->Apache, MSIIS, NGINX run on server
													Django/Python
													<-->Router URLS.py  |HTML|
														<-->Controller
															<-->Model or View
											<-----send back to Web Server
						<-----------send to client
			<---render to computer

AJAX - Asyncronis JavasScript A (?) XML (or JSON)
This sends all data from CMV to the device/computer to do all of the work
Agile ---also talks about this process

Rendering = takes tags, img, css, etc ....?

DOM = Document Object Model - This turns everything into objects to be displayed
