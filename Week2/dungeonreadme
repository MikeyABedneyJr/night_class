This game is in the form of a dungeon crawler.
Only you are a teacher trying to escape the school after a long week.
Students, coworkers, administration...they all require energy, patience, or excuses to get by them!

Your choices must be well-thought of else the doors will lock and you will need to sleep under your desk...which is exactly what the students think anyway.
