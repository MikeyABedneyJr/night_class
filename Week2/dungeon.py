# This is the main storyline of a game where your character is a teacher of a subject that you decide upon early
#  in the game.  It is a Friday and you are trying to make your way through 10 hallways to escape the building. 
#  Every hallway has a randomly generated opponent---student, parent, coworker, or administrator (main boss).
#  The player has the option to run, listen patiently, or create an excuse to leave. Every opponent has varying
#  percentages that each method will/won't work.  If any one of your three stats reaches 0, you lose and have to 
#  sleep under your desk because the doors to the school have been locked.
